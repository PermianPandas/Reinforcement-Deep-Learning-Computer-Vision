    "A non-actuated hinge that travels in a smooth orbit connects the rod to the carriage. The controlling mechanism is delivering a force of +1 or 1 to the cart. The pendulum begins upright in order to prevent falls. Every time step in which the bar remains upright will result in a +1 reward. When the bar is more than 15 degrees from vertical or the cart is more than 2.4 units from the centre, the episode finishes."

It includes a common API for communication between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a variety of environments that are consistent with that API. Since its inception, Gym's API has become the industry standard for achieving this."

    "The fastest solution was achieved in 247 episodes with parameters gamma = 0.995 and learning rate = 0.15. The overall findings tend to be better with a higher gamma of around 0.995. Of course, the random distribution of values in the Q-table plays an important role in reaching a quick answer.\n",
    "The average reward across 1000 episodes provides a more accurate picture of performance. After 5000 episodes, the average payment was about 149, and after 10,000 episodes, the average score was approximately 168, which is considered a success.\n",
    "Overall, Q-learning is a good way of learning in simple environments with few steps, where the agent can recall and duplicate earlier actions. In increasingly complicated issues, the Q-table would be unable to manage a large number of states and operations, rendering it impractical to use."
